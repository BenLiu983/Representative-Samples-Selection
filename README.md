# Representative samples selection in an implicit mixture model with the Approximation Maximization algorithm

Technological innovations have made a profound impact on knowledge discovery. Extracting useful samples from massive dataset is essential in many modern
scientific areas. In this project, we developed an Approximation Maximization (AM) algorithm to select representative samples in an implicit mixture model. 

# Methodology 
The detailed theoretical derivation of AM algorithm can be refer to the report.

This approach shows potential to improve the accuracy of estimated parameters of the explicit model, which helps us extract the representative samples out of a complicate
dataset. Experiments are conducted in 4 main cases, where the explicit models are Gaussian distribution, linear regression, logistics regression and Poisson regression, respectively. Under 3 different correlation structures among variables, the AM algorithm is robust and outperforms other method in terms of estimation accuracy and selection
consistency in most experiments.
